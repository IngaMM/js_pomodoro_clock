Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This Pomodoro clock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) counts down the set time of a work session (default: 25 minutes), indicates that it is break time,
counts down the break time (default: 5 minutes) and starts all over again. There are control buttons for start, pause and stop. The times for sessions and breaks can be selected individually. Buttons permit to switch earlier from session to break and vice versa.
